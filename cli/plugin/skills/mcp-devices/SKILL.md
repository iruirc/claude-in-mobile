name: mcp-devices
description: "This skill should be used when the user asks to interact with device screens (screenshot, annotate, tap, swipe, type text), manage apps (install, launch, stop, uninstall), transfer files (push, pull), query device info (logs, system info, clipboard, screen size), capture performance traces or heap artifacts, run shell commands, manage desktop windows, or automate Android, iOS, HarmonyOS, Aurora OS, or Desktop apps."

# mcp-devices native CLI

Fast CLI for mobile device automation across **Android** (via ADB), **iOS** (via simctl), **HarmonyOS** (via HDC), **Aurora OS** (via audb), and **Desktop** (via companion JSON-RPC app).

Binary: `mcp-devices-cli` (ensure it's in PATH or use its full path).

## Common Flags

| Flag | Description | Platforms |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `--device <serial>` | Android/HarmonyOS/Aurora device serial (default: first connected) | Android, HarmonyOS, Aurora |
| `--simulator <name>` | iOS Simulator name (default: booted) | iOS |
| `--companion-path <path>` | Path to Desktop companion app (or set `MOBILE_TOOLS_COMPANION` env) | Desktop |

## Tips

- Use `--compress` on screenshots when sending to LLM — reduces token usage significantly
- `analyze-screen` gives structured JSON of buttons/inputs/texts — useful for automated testing
- `find-and-tap` uses fuzzy matching with confidence scoring — good for flaky element names
- Aurora commands use `audb` (Aurora Debug Bridge) — similar to ADB
- Desktop commands communicate via JSON-RPC with a companion app over stdin/stdout
- Combine `ui-dump` + `tap --index N` for reliable element interaction by index
- Use `wait` between actions in automation scripts to allow UI transitions
