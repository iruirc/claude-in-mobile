 *
 * WDA is an untrusted external process on localhost:8100. On session
 * degradation it still answers HTTP 200 but with a `{status:0, value:null,
 * sessionId}` envelope. The historical `response.value || response` unwrap used
 * a falsy check, so a `value:null` envelope leaked through and was cast to a
 * tree/element/rect as if it were real data — the corruption only surfaced far
 * downstream (or, worse, silently produced `[]`). This error is raised at the
 * WDA trust boundary, where the response is first coerced to an internal type,
 * so degradation fails loud and local instead of poisoning callers.
